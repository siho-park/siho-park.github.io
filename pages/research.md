**Health screening and selection: Evidence from biennial subsidies in South Korea**

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Public health screening programs are widely used, but their effectiveness is questioned due to low participation among high-risk individuals who would benefit most from early diagnosis. I study selection into health screenings and their causal effects using quasi-random variation from South Korea’s National Health Screening Program, which subsidizes 90-100% of screening costs every other year at even-numbered ages. Using survey data, I find that subsidy eligibility increases screening completion by 16-19 percentage points (183-295%). Compliers with the subsidies are predominantly from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and are in poorer health than those who always participate regardless of subsidies. Using national health insurance claims data, I find that subsidy eligibility increases both early- and late-stage cancer diagnoses by 17-19%, as well as treatment for conditions including cancer precursors, hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, and osteoporosis. These results suggest that public health screenings with subsidies can effectively target high-risk individuals and promote preventive care use.

**Spousal spillover in health screening: Evidence from South Korea**

with Hyuncheol Bryant Kim and Jaehyun Jung

<p>&nbsp;</p>

This study investigates spousal spillover in health screenings using South Korea’s National Health Screening Program, which subsidizes 90–100% of screening costs biennially at even-numbered ages. Using spouse’s even age as an instrument, we estimate that a spouse’s screening increases one’s own participation by 7.9 percentage points, 37% of the direct subsidy effect. Evidence points to coordination as a key mechanism, as many couples undergo screening on the same day. We also find contrasting patterns of selection by own subsidy eligibility. Among subsidy-eligible individuals, those with low socioeconomic status (SES) are more likely to respond to their spouse’s screening, while among ineligible individuals, spillovers are concentrated among those with high SES. These results suggest that spousal spillover can be used to increase participation and reduce socioeconomic disparities in preventive care.

**Misinformation Belief, Health Behavior, and Labor Supply during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from Tricycle Drivers in Philippines**

with Hyuncheol Bryant Kim, Syngjoo Choi, Yasuyuki Sawada and Takashi Yamano

<p>&nbsp;</p>

This study aims to analyze the behavioral consequences of people's beliefs in conspiracy theories and misinformation surrounding COVID-19 vaccines. We employ unique panel data to examine the relationship of belief in misinformation, vaccination behavior, and labor supply of tricycle drivers in the Philippines. We find that individuals with higher risk preference are more likely to hold misinformed beliefs. These beliefs, in turn, are associated with reductions in vaccination and other preventive health behaviors. We also find that beliefs in misinformation delay workplace recovery.
